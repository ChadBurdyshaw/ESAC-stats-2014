TODO list for next time (29 Oct 2014)

- Likelihood lecture: change cost function to "Absolute Deviation" rather than "Least Absolute Deviation"

- Bayesian Lecture: Motivate MCMC (perhaps plot 2D posterior first, but then talk about curse of dimensionality)

- MCMC motivation: add a graphical description of the process, and perhaps an animation
